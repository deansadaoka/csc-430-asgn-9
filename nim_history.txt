Nim started being created in 2005 and was made public in 2008. 
Nim was originally named Nimrod. 
The first Nim compiler was written in Pascal. 
The Nim compiler is free and open-source. It is currently being developed by Andreas Rumpf and a group of community volunteers. 

Nim was created to be a language as fast as C, expressive as Python, and as extensive as Lisp. 
Nim is statistically typed. 
Nim supports Object Oriented programming with features like inheritance. 
Nim allows for generic functions. 
Nim's garbage collector is automatic, but it can be tuned and even turned off.
