Language developed and designed by a team lead by Andreas Rumpf. 
Nim started being created in 2005 and was made public in 2008. 
Nim was originally named Nimrod. 
The first Nim compiler was written in Pascal. 
The Nim compiler is free and open-source. It is currently being developed by Andreas Rumpf and a group of community volunteers.
