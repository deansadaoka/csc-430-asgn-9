Nim supports Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS) which allows for a lot of flexibility. 
See examples/hello_world.nim for an example of the many ways to call hello world

Nim supports identifier equality, allowing for more flexibility. 
For example, the identifiers varA, vara, and var_A are all the same. 

Nim has the feature stropping, which allows for variable names to be keywords. 
For example, if can be made into a variable name.
